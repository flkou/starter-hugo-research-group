* The spectrum from descriptive (exploratory) to interpretative (interrogative, theorized)
* Thematic analysis (TA, 主題分析)

  * Theme: a "patterned" response or meaning

    * different from a "feature"
    * not about quantity, e.g., frequency of sth coming up
  * Only provides method for analysis, without prescribing methods of data collection or ontological framework.
  * Seeks to identify "themes" across a dataset.
  * Varieties:

    * Inductive TA: generates analysis from the bottom up
    * Theoretical TA: guided by existing theory or concepts
    * Experiental TA: focuses on the participant's expreiences
    * Constructionist TA: How topics are constructed
