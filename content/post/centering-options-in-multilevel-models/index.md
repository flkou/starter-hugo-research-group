* When the focus is a level-1 predictor, or interaction or higher order terms involving only level-1 variables (including the case of polynomial regression): Group-mean center the level-1 predictor. 

  * Rationale: to remove between-group variations. 
* When the focus is a level-2 predictor, or interaction or higher order terms involving only level-1 variables: Grand mean-center the level-2 predictor, and grand mean-center the level-1 covariates. 

  * Rationale: if the level-1 covariates are group-mean centered, it will become orthogonal with level-2 variables, thus not partialled out.
* For cross-level interaction: Group mean-center the level-1 predictor, and grand-mean center the level-2 predictor.
