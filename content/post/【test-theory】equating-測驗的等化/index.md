* **Purpose**: Comparing scores from different forms of an exam.

  * Equating is NOT trying to find common metrics.
* **Operationalization**: To find a function y = f(x), transforming test score x from one test to score y from another test.

  * Turning x into standardized $z\_{x}$, which we assume to be the same as $z\_{y}$, then transforming $z_{y}$ to y.
  * Y = $\frac{{σ\_{y}}{{σ\_{x}}(x-{μ\_{X}})+{μ\_{y}}$
