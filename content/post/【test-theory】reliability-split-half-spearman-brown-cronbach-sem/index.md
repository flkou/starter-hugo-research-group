### Split-Half Reliability

* two halves may not be parallel
* coefficient depends on the grouping of items

### Spearman-Brown

* shorter tests are generally less reliable
* formula: $\frac{nr}{1+(n-1)r}$, $\frac{2r}{1+r}$ when n = 2 (i.e., split-half)

### Cronbach’s Alpha (or tau-equivalent reliability)

* mean of all possible split-half coefficients, corrected by Spearman-Brown
* correlation coefficients between split-halves = reliability coefficient = $\frac{σ\_{T}^2}{σ\_{X}^2}$
* formula: ($\frac{N}{N-1}$)(1-$\frac{Σσ_{j}^2}{σ^2}$)

  * number of items: N
  * sum of vairance of all items: $Σσ_{j}^2$
  * variance of total scores: $σ^2$
* alternative formula: $\frac{N^{2}\frac{ΣΣσ_{i, j}}{N(N-1)}}{σ^2}$ (i≠j)
* Cronbach's alpha is derived under the assumption of tau-equivalence
