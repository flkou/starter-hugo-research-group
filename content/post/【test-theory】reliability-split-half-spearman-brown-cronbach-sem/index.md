### Split-Half Reliability

* two halves may not be parallel
* coefficient depends on the grouping of items

### Spearman-Brown

* shorter tests are generally less reliable
* formula: $\frac{nr}{1+(n-1)r}$, $\frac{2r}{1+r}$ when n = 2 (i.e., split-half)

### Cronbach’s Alpha (or tau-equivalent reliability)

* mean of all possible split-half coefficients, corrected by Spearman-Brown
* correlation coefficients between split-halves = reliability coefficient = $\frac{σ\_{T}^2}{σ\_{X}^2}$
* formula: ($\frac{}{}$)(1-$\frac{}{}$)

$\frac{}{}$
