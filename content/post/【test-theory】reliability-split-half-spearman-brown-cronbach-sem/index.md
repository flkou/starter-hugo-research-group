### Split-Half Reliability

* two halves may not be parallel
* coefficient depends on the grouping of items

### Spearman-Brown

* shorter tests are generally less reliable
* formula: $\frac{nr}{1+(n-1)r}$, $\frac{2r}{1+r}$ when n = 2 (i.e., split-half)

### Cronbach’s Alpha

* mean of all possible split-half coefficients, corrected by Spearman-Brown
* correlation coefficients between split-halves = reliability coefficient = 
* formula: ()
