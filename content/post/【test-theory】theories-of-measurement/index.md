**Representational measurement theory**:

* describing real empirical systems.
* numerical relational system (NRS) parallelling empirical relational system (ERS), representing “equivalence classes”.
* relationships between the numbers should reflect corresponding relationships between the objects.
* (possibly many sets of) homomorphism from ERS to NRS.
* extensive or additive measurements from “concatenation operations”.
* degree ofhomogeneity and the degree of niqueness?

  * relates to Stevens’s (1946) classification
* central to the physical sciences, but are of little use in the social and behavioural sciences where concatenation operations are typically unavailable..
* conjoint measurement (e.g., Rasch): r(x, y) = x +y
* resistance of electrical components placed in parallel or in series
* isomorphism vs homomorphism

**Operational Measurement Theory:**

* “operations” used to identify or measure scientific concepts.
* avoids assuming an underlying reality.
* two classes::

  * focusing on single variables (e.g., paired comparisons and rating scales)
  * defining a variable in terms of others (e.g., unfolding methods?)

**Classical Measurement Theory:**

* all objects have certain “quantitative attribute”, either interval or ratio.
* we use nominal and ordinal scales just because not yet able to quantify.
* “how much” of a particular attribute an object has
* attributes, not objects, satisfy ordinal and additive relationships
* the classical theory discovers pre-existing relationships
* relating the hypothesized quantitative attributes to observable quantities within some theoretical framework (factor analysis can be an example)
