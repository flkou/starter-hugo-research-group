**Substantive validity**: “the extent to which that measure is judged to be reflective of, or theoretically linked to, some construct of interest”

* * vs. Construct validity: A broader concept that encompasses structural, substansive, and external components ([Loevinger](https://doi.org/10.2466/pr0.1957.3.3.635), 1957).
  * vs. Content validity: “the degree to which test item content is sampled representatively from a universe of content, implied by a theoretical definition of the behavioral dimension being measured” ([Holden & Jackson](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.47.3.459), 1979).
  * vs. Face validity: “the degree to which a test respondent views the content of a test as relevant for the situation being considered” (Wiggins, 1973; referenced by [Holden & Jackson](https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.47.3.459), 1979).
* The gold standard of substantive validity, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), requires large sample size. When sample size is limited, e.g., in a pretest or applied research setting, other means to assess substantive validity is needed.
* The method being proposed:

  * Item-sort test

    * respondents are given a set of constructs denned in everyday language, and a set of items, both randomly ordered.
    * respondents are asked to read each item and assign it to the one construct or concept that, in their judgment, the item best indicates.
    * Following [Mackenzie et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/0749-5978%2891%2990037-T).’s (1991) method, a category labeled “other” can also be provided.
    * after an assignment decision has been made for each item, respondents are asked to go back and look over, in turn, each concept and the items that they have assigned to it and to make any changes in assignment that they think are needed.
  * Proportion of substantive agreement: “the number of respondents assigning a measure to its posited construct” over “the total number of respondents”.
  * Substantive-validity coefficient: “the number of respondents assigning a measure to its posited construct” minus “the highest number of assignments of the item to any other construct in the set”, over “the total number of respondents”.
